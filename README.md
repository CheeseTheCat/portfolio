Hello Im James Hooper
this is my portfolio of what i have done with the programming language called python. Most of the files here I made my self and some others I worked on with another person.
Later I think it would be fun to learn some java and C# and create some fun games with my cousins.
If you want to contact me you can email me at jambhooper@gmail.com
have a great day.
